HTTP 1.1 

•	HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.

•	A client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.

•	It takes care of this problem by introducing persistent connections and pipelining. 

•	It keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.

HTTP 2

•	It uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.
 
•	The binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information.
 
•	Multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP (transport layer) connection.
 
•	Enables multiple concurrent responses to a client’s initial GET request.
 
•	It can split headers from their data, resulting in a header frame and a data frame.
